# Dashboard Kart√≥dromo - Sistema Completo

This is a kart rental management system built with [React](https://react.dev/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the frontend build tool and [Convex](https://convex.dev) as its backend.

This project is connected to the Convex deployment named [`small-goat-605`](https://dashboard.convex.dev/d/small-goat-605).

## Project Structure

- **Frontend**: The code is in the `src` directory and is built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- **Backend**: The code is in the `convex` directory
- **Path Aliases**: `@` is configured as an alias for the `src` directory

## Running the Application

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development servers (frontend and backend)
npm run dev
```

This will start both the Vite development server for the frontend and the Convex backend server.
